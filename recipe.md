Preheat oven and prepare springform pan: Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter an 8 or 9-inch springform pan and dust with flour. Or use an 8 or 9-inch round cake pan, butter and dust with flour and line the bottom with parchment paper.

Mix flour with baking powder and salt: Vigorously whisk together 1 cup of flour with baking powder, salt, and cinnamon and set aside.
Make batter: Using a mixer, beat the butter on medium high speed for 2 minutes. Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy, a couple minutes more. Stir in the vanilla extract.

Add the eggs one at a time and beat until well blended. Stir in the lemon zest if using.
Reduce the speed of the mixer to low and slowly add the flour mixture, beating until smooth.
Pour the batter into the prepared springform pan.

Toss berries with flour and lemon juice, spoon over batter: Combine the berries with the remaining teaspoon of flour and the lemon juice in a bowl. Spoon the berry mixture over the batter.

 Bake: Bake on middle rack in oven for 45 to 55 minutes at 350°F, or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean.

Remove from oven and let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes.

Carefully slide a thin knife around the edges of the cake to release it from the pan.

Dust with powdered sugar to serve: Transfer the cake to a platter, berry side up. Dust the cake with powdered sugar to serve.
